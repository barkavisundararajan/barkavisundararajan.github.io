## About

I am a final-year PhD student in Computing Science at the University of Aberdeen under the supervision of Dr. Yaji Sripada and Prof. Ehud Reiter. My research focuses on improving factual accuracy (how faithfully the summaries are grounded in the input data) and reducing hallucinations in data-to-text generation by analysing input quality and structure. I also refined a manual error annotation protocol for factual errors and am translating it into a structured, semi-automated evaluation framework to complement human evaluation.
